That's a really nice deep question
Thank you for asking
First of all it's important to recognize the absolute perfection of the human body
I am not talking about ooooo you are perfect as an esoteric statement
I mean how truly remarkable our bodies are
Body self heals
You get a paper cut and your body fixes it without you managing that project
Your brain is so sophisticated no one in this world is able to understand what exactly its full potential is and what exactly it does
And it is capable of learning up until the second of your death
Your cells are rejuvenate constantly without you even noticing it
and there are many more of these proofs of human body being designed / created perfectly by something superior than humans
That's just the starting point
Remember we (you, me and every human) are so much more than our bodies
We can (and do) overwrite our bodies regularly
Every person who smokes/drinks/gets high know the first time they smoke their body screams (coughs) saying What the hell is this
cough cough cough
Get this things out of me
cough cough cough
BUT “the full you” overwrites and says I don't care body
I want to smoke
aaand body yields
accepts and learns to accept the free will of the one who is in charge
BUT
There are many things we can not overwrite
Can't stop your body from self healing, can't will your heart to stop beating, can't stop your ears from hearing, etc etc etc
So there I recognized I have been given this perfect machine
Along with free will to move it, use it, abuse it, and even make it better
Then one day in Bali someone told me they (in Bali) believe when a dancer wears a mask it allows Gods to take over and use that body to dance
THAT
was how I was able to recognize my greatness (and your greatness, and every human's too)
